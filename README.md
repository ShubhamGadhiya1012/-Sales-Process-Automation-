### 1. **Web Scraping for Lead Data**
- Used Python's `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` to extract information like:
  - Company Name
  - Profile Link
  - About Company
  - Email
  - Company Website
  - Industry
  - Location
  - Source
- Data saved to an Excel file for campaign input.

### 2. **Uploading Excel and Parsing**
- Flask app lets users upload an `.xlsx` file with scraped data.
- Parsed using `pandas`, cleaned for missing emails and validated formats.

### 3. **Personalized Email Campaign**
- Email template includes placeholders like `{{Company Name}}` which are dynamically replaced.
- Emails are sent using Pythonâ€™s `smtplib` and `email.mime` libraries.
- Batch sending with delays and rotation of multiple SMTP accounts to avoid spam flags.

### 4. **Email Open and Click Tracking**
- Embedded a unique tracking pixel (a 1x1 transparent image) to detect opens.
- Wrapped website links with redirect routes to detect clicks.
- Flask routes:
  - `/track/open/<email>` for open tracking
  - `/track/click/<email>` for click tracking

### 5. **Analytics and Lead Categorization**
- Engagement metrics stored in a SQLite database (`analytics.db`).
- Report generated with:
  - Open rate
  - Click-through rate
  - Categorization:
    - **Hot Lead:** Opened and clicked
    - **Warm Lead:** Opened only
    - **Cold Lead:** No interaction
